# Ceylon experiments

Just a small collections of experiments in the Ceylon language, to explore and learn it.

## FirstSteps

Random code to explore the language.

## PlayingWithJS

Playground for experimenting with JS interoperation.<br>
I extracted [Ceylon-JSTypes](https://github.com/PhiLhoSoft/Ceylon-JSTypes) from there.

## DartSynonyms

Refers to the Synonyms page on the Dart site, comparing this language to others.
I added a file about Ceylon.

## 3rdParty

Various links (in Windows'  .url format, can be opened in a simple editor) about Ceylon or Ceylon projects.
And perhaps some samples of Ceylon source code.


[Ceylon-Collections](https://github.com/PhiLhoSoft/Ceylon-Collections) was there, but has been moved to its own project, too.

# Ceylon

**Factoid**

The Ceylon name is a play on the Java name (since it is a JVM language, and like many others, it secretly hope to be a better Java). Java and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) are both islands in the Indian Ocean, one growing mostly coffee, the other growing mostly tea...

    ;

Semi-colons are mandatory in Ceylon, unlike several modern languages. As said in the [language FAQ][1], it is a compromise in syntax.<br>
Note in that languages where semi-colons are optional (JavaScript, Scala, Lua, etc.) but where lines can be split arbitrarily, there are often cases where missing semi-colons can result in ambiguous or unexpected expressions...

    4T

is a valid literal number in Ceylon. It reads "four tera" and its value is `4_000_000_000_000`. Ceylon supports, like Java, digit grouping, and unlike lot of languages, number suffixes from `f` (femto, `e-15`) to `P` (peta, `e+15`).


**Length 3**

    A|B

is a type which is the union of two disjoint types. This means that the value with this type can be of either `A` or `B` type. Since Ceylon does not support method overloading, it allows to define methods accepting various inputs in the same parameter, or various outputs. This feature is great to indicate a value can be null (it can't by default) and to support JavaScript dynamic types.


**Length 4**

    {C*}

Type annotation for a stream of instances of the class `C`. This stream can be evaluated lazily. That's actually a shortcut for the `Iterable<C>` type.


**Length 5**

    value

Ceylon is strictly typed, but is able of type inference, ie. you don't have to specify the type of a local variable (or of the return value of a local function) if the compiler can infer it.<br>
You _have_ to spell it out for class fields, function parameters, etc.<br>
So you can declare a local variable with the `value` keyword in place of the real type, the compiler will guess its type from its assignment. Note that the term "variable" isn't right here, as it will be immutable (the default of local declarations, you have to declare them variable explicitly to mutate them).<br>
I will continue to use the term variable here, even if they are immutable...


**Length 6**

    Float?

Type of a float variable that might be null. By default, Ceylon values cannot be null. We have to declare explicitly if null is possible in the type of the declaration itself. And then, the Ceylon compiler forces us to check if the value is null. Thus, we can never have a `NullPointerException`, which doesn't exists in the language! It is one of the rare totally null-safe languages (Rust is another one, with a very different approach).<br>
Note that this type declaration is actually a shortcut for `Float|Null`, ie. as seen above, the union of `Float` and of the `Null` type (which has only one instance: `null`).<br>
Also note that `Float` is a class on its own, with methods. It is optimized to the Java `float` primitive by the compiler, though.


**Length 7**

    Float[]

Type of a sequence of float values which can be empty. It is a shortcut for `Sequential<Float>` and can be written `[Float*]`, similar to the stream / iterable annotation. The difference is that a sequential can be indexed with the `[i]` notation, like an array. For the record, a `Sequence<T>` (or `[T+]`) is a sequential that cannot be empty. An empty sequential has the type `Empty` and is noted `[]`, of course.<br>
Note that `seq[i]` where `seq` is a `Float[]` is of type `Float?` ie. the result can be `null`, if the index is out of the bounds.


**Length 8**

    a else b

As seen above, if `a` is of type `A?` ie. can be `null`, you cannot use it without checking if it is null. It cannot be done with `a == null`, Ceylon offers various ways to check this. The code above is one of them: if `a` isn't null, use its value, otherwise, use the value of `b` (which cannot be null, of course; we can chain the checks...).


**Length 9**

    \{BULLET}

is a valid Ceylon character: you can put any Unicode name between the braces, like `\{CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)}` or `\{WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS}`.


**Length 10**

    if(is T v)

As we seen, we can define union types, meaning that a variable can have one of several types, eg. `Integer` or `Float` (or `Byte` or... etc.).<br>
If all the subtypes derivate from the same interface, we can use the methods of the parent interface.<br>
For example, if we have `ArrayList<String> | LinkedList<String> dualList`, we can use `dualList.size` directly.<br>
To use a method specific to one of the member of the union, you have to be sure it is of the given type.
For this, Ceylon offers a mechanism allowing in the same shot to check the type, and to downcast it to the specific type: `if (is ArrayList dualList) { Integer capacity = dualList.capacity; }` is legal because at this point, the compiler is sure to have an `ArrayList`.<br>
It is equivalent to Java's `instanceof` and cast in the same shot, just safer: in Java, you can cast to something else than the type you checked!<br>
Note that `is` is also an operator (resulting in a `Boolean`) that doesn't narrow down the type. `Boolean b = v is T;`


**Length 11**

    "N ``p.n``"

Ceylon has string interpolation: you can embed in a literal string an expression between a pair of double backticks. The value of the expression will replace this placeholder. You can have simple local values, field access as shown, complex expressions or function calls. You can have literal strings (with interpolation too!) inside these expressions.


**Length 12**

    f=(A p)=>-p;

Assigns to the `f` variable an anonymous function defined with the short syntax (fat arrow).
Functions are first-class citizens in Ceylon, they are just objects that can be assigned, passed as parameter, returned from another function, etc.<br>
To fit in the length, I omitted the declaration of `f` which can be done earlier, for example: `A(A) f;`<br>
Here, `f` returns the negation of the `p` parameter which has the type `A`.<br>
Notice the usage of the negation operator `-` which must have been overloaded in the definition of `A`, which then must satisfy the interface `Invertible<A>`.<br>
Ceylon doesn't support to define arbitrary operators (unlike Scala, where users can get crazy with this feature... :-)), nor even "true" operator overloading, but it supports operator polymorphism: operators are defined (by name, eg. `negated` for the unary minus) in specific interfaces (here `Invertible`) that classes needing these operators must implement (must satisfy, in Ceylon vocabulary).


**Length 13**

    C<out T>(T t)

Declaration-site variance: the class `C` (the `class` keyword and the class body have been omitted for brevity) declares, in its definition, its type parameter `T` to be _covariant_, so `C<Car>` is a subtype of `C<Vehicle>` if `Car` is a subtype of `Vehicle`.<br>
Collection interfaces (immutable by default), like `List` or `Set` are declared covariants.<br>
Mutable collections must satisfy an additional interface with a _contravariant_ declaration (`<out T>`), defining methods accepting the given class or any supertype of it: a mutable list of `Vehicle` must accept adding `Car`s.<br>
Java is using use-site variance, like `List<? extends Car>`, defined on each `List` declaration. It is a bit more flexible but puts the burden on the users of the class, so is more cumbersome.<br>
Since version 1.1, Ceylon also support use-site variance for Java interoperability reasons, but promotes declaration-site variance as the preferred method.<br>
Also note the parameter list of the class: it defines both the parameters of the constructor of the class, and the corresponding fields, in the same shot! No need for these cumbersome `this.t = t;`...


**Length 14**

    for(n in 0..5)

Ceylon doesn't have the classical C-like numerical `for` loop. Instead, it supports range definitions, and allows to iterate on them.<br>
Here, `n` (whose type, `Integer`, is inferred) will go from 0 to 5, included. We could have written `0:6` instead (start, number of items). A range like `5..0` allows count-downs.<br>
These notations are just syntax sugar for declaring instances of the `Range<T>` class. We can have ranges of numbers, characters or any other type `T` satisfying the `Enumerable` interface.


**Length 15**

    return["",0.0];

Return statement in a function. Here, the type of the return value is `[ String, Float ]`. That's a tuple, of type `Tuple`.<br>
A tuple is linked list (therefore a `Sequence`) which captures the static type of each individual element in the list.<br>
We can then access safely each element by its index: `Float v = tuple[1];`; the compiler knows the size of the tuple and the type of each entry.<br>
Tuples are a practical / compact mean to return several values from a function, where in Java we must create a _Pojo_ (simple, often internal, class with just fields) for this.<br>
Side note: Ceylon doesn't accept abbreviated, unreadable (IMHO) shortcuts for floats: neither `0.` nor `.0` are accepted, we must write `0.0`.


**Length 16**

    shared T v=T(1);

A variable or attribute of a class (field in Java vocabulary) declaration. The variable is immutable (the default) and has a visibility annotation. Unlike Java fields, attributes (and variables) don't have an implicit default value  so they must be assigned at the declaration site (or must be, for attributes, in the parameter list of the class).<br>
Note that `T(1)` creates a new instance of T with one parameter. Unlike Java, we don't need the `new` keyword.<br>
`shared` is an annotation, not a keyword. Declarations are private by default, visible only in the code unit where they are declared: the class they belong to, or the package of the file where they are declared, if they are top-level.<br>
`shared` extends the visibility to the parent: a shared declaration in a class is visible in the class enclosing this class, if any, or otherwise in the whole package containing the class. If a top-level declaration is shared, it is visible to everything that can see the containing package. If the package is shared, it is visible (and its shared declarations) by other packages in the same module, and by code in other modules which import that module.
Works like Russian puppets...<br>
We introduced two concepts: packages are like in Java, folders in a folder hierarchy where the path defines a namespace / visibility unit. They allow to organize code in logical groups. Unlike Java, we _must_ declare packages in a special file named `package.ceylon` in the package they belong to. That's where we declare if a package is shared (or not, by default). On the other hand, we don't have to declare the package on each file of the folder...<br>
Modules are groups of packages, also declared in their own file (`module.ceylon`) at the root of the package hierarchy.
They _must_ declare a version number, and _must_ import the modules (with their version number) used in code belonging to this module. This allows modularity of the code with fine grained management of the required versions.


**Length 17**

    assert(exists x);

Like in Java, `assert` throws an exception if its expression is false. But unlike Java, the compiler knows that after the `assert` statement, the condition is true. Here, the expression checks if `x`, of type `T?` (remember: that's `T | Null` ie. either `T` or `Null`), exists, ie. is not `null`. So the compiler accepts to use `x.foo` after the `assert` in the same block, because it known it isn't null.<br>
`exists` can be used in a `if` too, if that's unsure. `assert` is used if the programmer knows for sure (except programming error!) that a variable initially null has been set to a non-null value at this point in the code. So `assert` is used here as a helper of the type checker of the compiler which hasn't flow analysis...


**Length 18**

    class C(Float f){}

Declares a class and its constructor and its attributes in the same shot: the class' parameters are those of the constructor of the class, which then doesn't need to be defined explicitly. These parameters become attributes (equivalent to Java's fields), so no need for `this.f = f`, the syntax is streamlined, without boilerplate.<br>
Note that a class can have only one constructor, because Ceylon doesn't support method overloading. Instead, it has parameters with default values (and therefore optional parameters), named parameters, etc.<br>
It also implies that the class has an _initializer_ section, containing a mix of declarations, statements and control structures. The initializer is executed every time the class is instantiated and initializes the state of the new instance of the class.

# Proposals from  Lucas Werkmeister

**Length 10** ["Mike",9] Tuples (and tuple types, `[String,Integer]`) are written in brackets. However, they’re not a magical built-in construct: That syntax is just syntactic sugar for the regular `Tuple` class, which forms a typed linked list. When you access a tuple by a constant index (e. g. `t[1]`), the compiler arrives at the correct type (here, the second element type of the tuple type) by rewriting it to a series of `(.rest)*.first` (here, `t[1]` = `t.rest.first`), which navigates the linked list of types correctly.

**Length 11** class C(xy) Classes have parameter lists; the class body contains not only a *declaration section* (containing regular attributes, methods, etc.), but also an *initializer section*, which is executed each time the class is instantiated. This allows you to check preconditions and run other initialization code like in a constructor in other languages, but for simple “container” classes removes a lot of boilerplate (`this.name = name; this.age = age;`) since the initializer parameter can also be `shared` as an attribute of the class. Since this can lead to cluttering in the class’ parameter list, Ceylon also allows you to split the declaration of a parameter out of the parameter list; in the example above, `xy` would be declared somewhere in the body (e. g. `shared [Float,Float] xy;`). (For the record, the next version of Ceylon will introduce actual [constructors](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-spec/issues/796) as well.)

**Length 12** "Hi ``you``" Ceylon uses double backticks for string interpolation. You can also use the `+` operator like in some other languages (`String` satisfies `Summable`), but using backticks is better because it doesn’t break up multi-line strings: With backticks, the later fragments will still be aligned to the column of the original string start, whereas with `+`, a new string literal starts, which has to be aligned separately.

**Length 13** C<out T>(T t) Ceylon features **declaration-site variance**: The class `C` declares its type parameter to be *covariant*, so therefore `C<Car>` is a subtype of `C<Vehicle>` automatically. This applies naturally to unmodifiable collections: Of course a `List<Integer>` is also a `List<Number>`. In languages with *use-site variance*, on the other hand, you would have to specify the variance each time you use it – for example, in Java: `List<? extends Car>`.
